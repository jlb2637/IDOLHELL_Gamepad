# IDOLHELL_Gamepad
An Arduino based arcade style controller for my friends first game released on Steam!

This is a super fun and short project to create an Arduino based arcade style game controller.
The goal of this project is to be able to use arcade style joystick and buttons to play games on Steam.
Specifically IDOL HELL, a game created by some of my friends! Check it out here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2067470/Idol_Hell/

# Physical build

*talk about CAD of box here*

# Electronics

The electronics here are pretty simple, just digital I/O pins!

*insert schematic here*

# Code

The code was pretty nice to work through because of the Arduino Keyboard.h libraries available
